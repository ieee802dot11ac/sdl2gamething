# sdl2gamething
a thing in sdl2 featuring hardcoded directories
the only reason i'm making a github repo is so i can get help with it
things to note: 
- g++ and all other mingw bins for me are located at C:/Program Files/mingw-w64/x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0/mingw64/bin
and the only reason for that is that i have yet to find a workaround
